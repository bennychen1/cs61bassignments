There will be three larger programming projects and a warm-up miniproject The projects will be individual efforts with the same collaboration rules as HW Youll
have later classes that will provide more opportunities to build your teamwork skills. For Sixty-One B, our goal is to help you build the independence
and fundamental skills that youll need to thrive when building large programs

Projects will have some other tests that we will not report to you
 Thus passing all make check tests will not necessarily guarantee
 receiving full points on the autograded portion of the project
  This is intended to encourage you to write your own tests to provide a more complete test suite

Miniproject Zero and projects One, Two, and Three will be worth x, y, z, and z points respectively There may be extra credit opportunities on some projects
